# Estimation of the Limit of Obesity-Causing Variables Before It Turns into the Disease
Obesity is a disease where the body has excessive fat accumulation due to the imbalance between calories consumed and expended. According to the World Health Organization, the main cause of obesity is the consumption of foods that are high in fat and sugar, and physical inactivity. In the field of medicine, prevention is always better than cure. Being able to predict a person’s overall health is significant as it can help prevent illnesses, such as obesity. This can be done by developing a predictive model that incorporates an individual’s eating habits, along with other factors that identify their physical condition such as their age, weight, family history, and many others, which can provide an estimation of their obesity level

## Dataset
The <a href="https://github.com/f1-sanchez/CIND-820-Project/blob/main/codes/EDA.ipynb">Obesity dataset</a> used in this project is from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has a total of 2111 instances and 17 attributes, with a class variable NObesity which represents the obesity level.

## Project Stages
#### Research
Conduct extensive research on obesity levels and other related topics, including the methodologies used in the part by other researchers.

#### Data Collection
Download the dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and import into Python.

#### Data Cleaning
The dataset is checked for any incorrect data, missing values, and duplicates.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
This is conducted to have a basic understanding of the data. It identifies the patterns and correlations between the features and the class variable. <a href="https://github.com/f1-sanchez/CIND-820-Project/blob/main/codes/EDA.ipynb">Click here to view the codes used in EDA.</a>

#### Machine Learning Models
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes will be used.

#### Conclusion
This will include the model that performed the best, along with the interpretation of the results and any possible recommendations.
